## Analysis Questions

### Majority Voting vs Individual Classifiers
From the `results_df`, we can compare the *Mean Accuracy* of the **Voting Classifier** with the individual classifiers (**Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**).

- Voting Classifier: **0.940909**  
- Logistic Regression: **0.941818**  
- KNN: **0.951818**  
- Decision Tree: **0.922727**  
- Random Forest: **0.931818**

The Voting Classifier performs comparably to or slightly better than Logistic Regression and KNN, and better than the Decision Tree and Random Forest in terms of mean accuracy on the Iris dataset.

Ensembles like the majority voting classifier typically perform better than individual classifiers because they combine the predictions of multiple models. This reduces the impact of individual model biases and variances. By aggregating predictions, the ensemble can capture a wider range of patterns and make more robust predictions.

However, there are cases where an ensemble might perform worse than a single, well-tuned individual classifier. This can happen if the individual classifiers are not diverse (make similar errors) or if the ensemble method is not well-suited to the dataset.

### Bagging Analysis
We compared a single Decision Tree with a Bagging classifier using Decision Trees as base estimators.

**Results:**
- Decision Tree (train/test): **1.000 / 0.833**  
- Bagging (train/test): **1.000 / 0.917**

This shows that while the single Decision Tree perfectly fits the training data (overfitting), it performs worse on unseen data. The Bagging classifier generalizes better, reducing overfitting.

**How does changing the number of estimators in bagging affect performance?**  
Increasing the number of estimators generally improves performance (reduces variance), but after a point, the returns diminish, while computational cost increases.

**What is the effect of bootstrap sampling vs using the entire dataset?**  
- Bootstrap sampling: introduces diversity, each estimator trains on a slightly different dataset.  
- Using the entire dataset: all estimators are identical → defeats variance reduction.  

**Why does bagging reduce overfitting compared to a single tree?**  
A single tree overfits; bagging trains many trees on bootstrap samples. Each overfits differently, but their averaged predictions cancel out individual errors → less variance, better generalization.

### AdaBoost Insights
**How does the learning rate affect performance?**  
- Small learning rate → each learner contributes less, needs more iterations.  
- Large learning rate → faster convergence, but risk of overfitting.  

**Error convergence plot analysis:**  
- Training error steadily decreases.  
- Test error decreases initially, then may plateau or increase → overfitting.  

**Why does test error sometimes increase after many iterations?**  
AdaBoost keeps fitting misclassified samples, which can lead to fitting noise. This reduces generalization.

**Why are decision stumps good base estimators?**  
- They’re weak learners (slightly better than random).  
- Simple and fast to train.  
- AdaBoost combines many of them adaptively, producing a strong learner.

### Comparative Performance
**Which ensemble performed best on Iris?**  
- KNN: **0.951818** (highest mean accuracy).  
- Logistic Regression and Voting Classifier: close behind (~0.941).  
- Ensembles didn’t outperform KNN here, due to the dataset’s characteristics.

**Why?**  
- Iris is small with well-separated classes → KNN naturally works well.  
- Ensembles help more on complex or noisy datasets.  
- Hyperparameter tuning could change results.  

**How does Random Forest relate to Bagging?**  
- **Bagging**: trains trees on bootstrap samples (all features considered at splits).  
- **Random Forest**: same as bagging but adds *random feature selection at splits*.  
  → Further decorrelates trees, improves robustness, reduces overfitting.  

**When to choose each method?**  
- **Voting**: When you have diverse strong base classifiers.  
- **Bagging/Random Forest**: When you want to reduce variance, especially with trees.  
- **Boosting (AdaBoost, XGBoost, etc.)**: When you want to reduce bias and sequentially improve weak learners.

### Practical Considerations

**Computational trade-offs:**
- **Voting**: Cost = sum of base classifiers. Can parallelize.  
- **Bagging (Random Forest)**: Highly parallelizable. Cost = single base learner × number of estimators.  
- **Boosting**: Sequential → harder to parallelize, more costly than bagging.  

**Bias-Variance tradeoff:**
- More estimators → lower variance, but higher computation.  
- Boosting reduces bias, Bagging reduces variance.  

**Real-world scenarios:**
- **Voting**: Combining diverse ML models in production.  
- **Bagging/Random Forest**: High-variance learners (e.g., decision trees) on noisy datasets.  
- **Boosting**: Structured/tabular datasets, competitions (Kaggle), cases where every small accuracy improvement matters.
